                        across all response variables. The function
                        takes 2 independent variables.
comp_linkedto_pathways
                        counts total no of compounds that are linked to
                        KEGG pathways
compoundinfo            Counts total no of compound in a pathway that
                        has been linked to significant metabolites This
                        will help in calculating HG score for
                        metabolite enrichment
convert_refmet          Associates refmet class to the metabolites
dotplot_met_class_path
                        Plots dot plot pf PATHWAY and Metabolite class
enzyme_gene_info        Gets gene and enzyme info
getmwstudies            Gets metabolomics data, metadata and metabolite
                        info from Metabolomics Workbench using REST
                        service
ls_path                 compound linked to kegg pathways
map_keggid              Assigns kegg id to the significant metabolites
mapspspath              Maps species specific pathways This is
                        important because sometimes some species may
                        not have some pathways
met_pathways            Gives information on pathways linked to
                        significant metabolites specific to species of
                        choice
metclassenrichment      Provides enrichment score of the selected
                        metabolic class via hypergeometric score
metcountplot            counts and plots significant metabolite
path_enrichmentscore    Calculates pathway enrichment score of the
                        pathways linked to significant metabolites
pathinfo                Provides pathway or orthology information from
                        reaction data of significant metabolite
plot_heatmap            Plots heatmap
plot_met_enrichment     Plots metabolite enrichment score
plot_pathway_networks   Plots 1st degree pathway network of only
                        pathways having significant pathway score
plot_volcano            Plots Volcano plot
react_substrate         Gets information whether metabolite is a
                        product or substrate
rxninfo                 Gives details of reactions for the metabolites
separate_data           Separates user data into metadata and
                        metabolomics data with metabolite measurements
significant_met         Provides log2fold change and p value on
                        metabolomics data using t test.
significant_met_own     Provides log2fold change and p value on custom
                        metabolomics data using t test.
